    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>8 crunchy Japanese or Persian cucumbers</li>
      <li>5 teaspoons salt (to draw out moisture)</li>
      <li>5 1/2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Slice all the cucumbers very thinly (ideally with a mandolin slicer for uniformity) and transfer to a medium
        sized bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle with salt and toss with your hands to ensure even salt coverage to draw out moisture. Let it sit for
        10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rinse the cucumbers thoroughly to remove the salt, drain, then squeeze all the cucumbers to remove excess
        moisture. The goal is to remove as much water as you can. Don't be afraid to squeeze hard, the cucumbers can
        take it!
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix dressing ingredients: rice vinegar, sugar, salt, soy sauce until dissolved, then add to cucumbers to
        marinate for at least 1 hour. It keeps well overnight too. Keep refrigerated until serving.
      </li>
      <li>Sprinkle with sesame seeds just before serving.</li>
    </ol>
