    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>80g brown sugar</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons water</li>
      <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tablespoon baking powder</li>
      <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tablespoon water (for mixing with baking powder)</li>
      <li>120g cake flour (and some more for dusting)</li>
      <li>240g sweet red bean paste (anko)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Cut a sheet of parchment paper into 12 6x6cm sheets.</li>
      <li>In a small saucepan, add 3 tablespoons of water and the brown sugar. Whisk to dissolve the sugar over medium-low heat.</li>
      <li>Transfer to a large bowl and set aside to cool.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, wet your hands with a little bit of water and make 12 balls of sweet red bean paste. Each ball should be about 1 scant tablespoon (20g).</li>
      <li>Combine <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tablespoon of baking powder and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tablespoon of water.</li>
      <li>Add to the cooled brown sugar mixture and mix all together.</li>
      <li>Sift the cake flour and add to the brown sugar mixture. Stir the mixture using a silicone spatula, chopsticks or your fingers. Pinch the clumps together into a ball. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and set aside to rest for 15 minutes in the bowl.</li>
      <li>Transfer the dough to a floured work surface and knead for 1 to 2 minutes, incorporating flour as necessary to get rid of the stickiness. The texture of the dough should be pliable (similar to the texture of the earlobe). Do not over-knead.</li>
      <li>Once the dough is no longer sticky and smooth, form the dough into a stick and cut into 12 pieces.</li>
      <li>Cover them with a damp towel to prevent the dough from drying.</li>
      <li>Form one portion of the dough into a ball and flatten it so it becomes 5 cm in diameter.</li>
      <li>Then, flatten the piece with your fingers and roll out to form a circle shape about 6 to 7 cm in diameter. You should only stretch the outer edges of the dough, keeping the center thick.</li>
      <li>Place the red bean ball in the middle and pull each corner into the center and pinch to close the dough. Now you know wy we need the outer dough to be thin. If you have the thick outer dough, the pinched area will be harder to fold in.</li>
      <li>Place the manju on the working surface, seam side down. Rotate the dough a few times to shape it nicely and place it on the parchment paper.</li>
      <li>Cover the manju with a damp towel to prevent it from drying. Repeat with the remaining dough.</li>
      <li>Set up a steamer. Fill the wok (or pot) with 2 inches of water and boil it. Steam for 10 to 12 minutes at high heat (this creates lots of steam).</li>
      <li>Once they are done cooking, remove manju from the steamer and let cool on a wire rack or bamboo sieve (so that the air/heat won't be trapped on the bottom of the manju). While they are still warm, wrap each manju with plastic wrap individually. This will help retain the moisture. Enjoy!</li>
