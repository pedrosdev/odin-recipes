# Recipes Website

A simple website containing a few of my favourite recipes.

The live website can be found [here](https://pedrosdev.github.io/odin-recipes/).

The main purpose of this project is to put into practice what I've learned of\
typography, images and links. At the end of this project, I should feel more\
comfortable at working with text and including images and links in HTML pages.
